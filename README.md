## MLOps Lab 2 – FastAPI ML Inference Service

---

## Project Overview

This repository contains **Lab 2** for the course **IE7374: MLOps**.

The objective of this lab is to build a production-style machine learning service using FastAPI, including:

- Model training and serialization
- REST API deployment for inference
- Health monitoring endpoint
- Automated unit testing
- Continuous Integration using GitHub Actions

This project demonstrates core MLOps principles including modular architecture, reproducibility, testing, and CI automation.

---

## Problem Statement

Deploy a machine learning classification model as a web service that:

1. Accepts structured input
2. Returns model predictions
3. Provides confidence scores
4. Includes health monitoring
5. Is automatically validated via CI pipeline

---

## Model Details

- Dataset: Iris Dataset
- Model Type: Scikit-learn Classifier
- Output: Species class prediction (0, 1, 2)
- Confidence: Maximum predicted probability
- Serialization Format: Pickle (`.pkl`)
